MunozMateosDustMass
===================

Quick computations for astronomical research. 

A brief class/UI that runs the Munoz-Mateos empirical mathematical calibrations of the Draine/Li 07
dust model as outlined in "Draine, B. T., et al. 2007, ApJ, 663, 866". The related paper that 
defines these calculations is "Munoz-Mateos, et al. 2009, ApJ, 701, 1965"
